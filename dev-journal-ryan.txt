=== alpha 2.5 ===
It's been too long since I had a chance to work on this and I want to get an alpha 2.5 release out.

I need to push this back in an change my current branch name. I think it's alpha3 at the moment.

=== jsperf ===
I wrote a perf for point & linestring bbox cache testing. The test makes me think jQuery.data doesn't do what I think it's doing. When I cache the bbox in a local var, it's very fast but when I cache with data, it's not.

* Here's the point test: http://jsperf.com/point-vs-bbox
* Here's the line test: http://jsperf.com/line-vs-bbox

It's always faster to test points by themselves, i.e., don't worry about checking for a cached the bbox.

=== branch ===
I was on master, so I pushed, then created & switched to alpha2-5.

=== opacity ===
When developing the heat map example, I remember running into an issue where I couldn't get the opaicty to look right between the border and center. Maybe I fixed it somewhere else because I can't seem to reproduce that.

I can still get it on the latest fiddle of the heat map. It's when the opacity is 1 and the strokeOpacity is 0, the stroke still shows up but it should be hidden.

I still can't recreate this on the shapeStyle test page :( Ah, but the twitter heat example has the issue.

Turns out I was or'ing the stroke/fillOpacity with regular opacity in _getGraphicStyle. That's not the right place to do anything with them, and never or.

=== service opacity ===
I'm going to pull in the service opacity method from AppGeo.Web as "opacity" on each service object, like refresh.

That's done. I haven't documented/implemented what happens if you don't pass a service id. It's required. I'm not sure what I want that to do yet.

=== visible ===
When starting to think about geomap.toggle, I realize I have a naming conflict so to speak. The service object has a boolean visible property while the shape style has a string visibility property. I think I want to change the service to match the shape style. I don't think there are any attributes in HTML that pertains to visibility so I'm going to match CSS even in the service object which is more internal and less graphical. That said, I don't want to start renaming things in alpha 2.5 so that'll wait until 3.

SUGGESTION: Rename service.visible to visibility having either "visible" or "hidden" values

=== service props ===
So, I noticed that when a service is created, I don't modify the service objects to fill all the supported properties. So, when toggle is called, there's potentially not an initial visible property set.

I think for now, alpha 2.5, I will have the toggle function assume that there could be an undefined service.visible. The refresh method does the same. Later, though I think I might want to set defaults during _createServices.

=== proj ===
New projection code seems to work and is awesomely 150 lines shorter!

=== resize ===
I'm going to hook into the window resize event automatically but I will still need a resize method later in case the dev changes the div size/css.

SUGGESTION: Add a resize method to let geomap know the div has changed size programatically

I'm not sure of the correct way to kill & remake graphics now that it's a jQuery UI widget. It appears that I can call distroy & re-create it.

Resize, is working though when getting smaller, there is a space for the scroll bars. I don't remember having that issue with the internal AppGeo.Web control. That is an issue to tackle after alpha 2.5.

=== dbl tap ===
What is a thumb? On touch devices, and other soft-dblclick devices I don't take into account that the second click/tap might be too far from the first to count as a tap. There is no move event to cancel. I'm now calculating distance between the two based on _anchor (previous) and _current ( current :). This will need testing. I'm setting it at 10px for now, line 1480 of geomap.js as of this writing.

== 2011-07-19 ==
=== wkt ===
Wrote up some to-WKT code for our internal control today. WKT will also be supported by parseWKT and textify methods in $.geo.

SUGGESTION: Support WKT with $.geo.parseWKT (like JSON.parse or $.parseJSON) and $.geo.textify (like JSON.stringify).

=== centroid ===
Wrote up some centroid code for all but GeometryCollection as well for our internal control. Code similar to this will end up in $.geo.centroid.

== 2011-07-15 ==
=== presentation ===
My first real talk about $.geo went well, I think. Next up is FOSS4G in September and, possibly, jQuery Conference Boston in October & Harvard WWW in December.

=== alpha 2.5 ===
I think I want to push out a bug-fix release of the alpha 2 tech. I'll tag it as alpha 2.5 in github but overwrite the alpha2 js file on host. Well, rename the old one as alpha2.0 in case people find a bug in the new one.

I need to write down exactly what to do for alpha 2.5.

=== shape images ===
People really want images on shapes, particularly points. I'm removing this feature from my TO DO list:
* geomap - Document and implement passing a function to shapeStyle and append that returns a geomap style object based on feature or geometry properties
because I have a much better plan that involves the label div. It will be a normal div and have a class. Each will have relative position and designers can manipulate it however they want.

== 2011-07-12 ==
=== fiddles ===

== 2011-07-07 ==
=== bbox ===
I added bbox caching! I even check to see if the GeoJSON object has a bbox property, which is legal. There's no way to update the bbox but that'll come later.

=== distance ===
I almost tried to have distance support taking in a Feature but that opens a whole can of worms. I'm going to fix find to only send base geometry types to distance.

DOCUMENT: geometry methods will only take base geometry types (Point, LineString, Polygon & Multi*) or coordinate arrays

I had some weird comment on this method, it should be documented to only take base types, as I just said.

=== form input ===
I was talking to Chris last night about what geomap does that others don't and he reminded my about the idea I had of keeping a hidden input of the shapes as WKT. This would mean that I had to have a property on geomap for the map's name and also definitely change the service object to use name instead of id for when I add service-level shapes. WKT becomes a problem though when they've added features. I suppose I would dig into the features and only pull the geometry.

=== json ===
It's been a while since alpha 2. I'm working on a demo that draws the US state boundaries as graphics.

== 2011-06-30 ==
=== min ===
Srsly? I wasn't using minified jQuery in my examples? Wow.

== 2011-06-29 ==
=== alpha2 ===
Released alpha 2. I don't think anyone's really using it yet though.

== 2011-06-28 ==
=== on services ===
I think it would be nice to deep extend service objects that come in via the services property if a service with the given id already exists in _currentServices. This way, you could set the initial opacity of OSM by simply sending {services: [{id: "OSM", opacity: .8}]} during init.

SUGGESTION: deep extend existing service objects when services property is set

=== on opacity ===
I was beginning to try to throw the opacity & toggle methods into alpha2 but setting the services property is too flickery. I want to do it more like the old widget but that will require adding opacity and toggle methods into the services types. That will have to wait. It will be much faster to call the opacity/toggle methods on geomap than to set the services property each time. I will have to document that.

SUGGESTION: require opacity and toggle functions in the service type objects

== 2011-06-27 ==
=== on events ===
I almost forgot that I don't want bboxchange to fire when the developer changes a property in code. Unlike jQuery UI, my events trigger only when the user does something.

=== on alpha 2 ===
I'm trying to put this together.

== 2011-06-24 ==

=== on shape methods ===
I'm almost done. I need to finish empty and then I have what I wanted for an alpha 2 release!

=== on Point vs. coordinate ===
I think I'm going to settle on using Point objects everywhere except the projection functions. Which means I need to change find to accept a Point instead of an array. This should work out because the position events already send GeoJSON objects instead of position arrays.

=== on geometry ===
contains doesn't care about projections. Lon/lat values do not need to be projected.

I got done some of the geometry functions in $.geo but I'm leaving them private for now until I have a chance to document them and fully implement them.

=== on proj ===
Finished changing the $.geo.proj docs to explain that it will convert any GeoJSON coordinates array. I think I will also change the requirements to implement other projections by having the developer only have to override single position conversion functions (instead of worrying about the dimentionality of the passed array). Done.

=== on find ===
Now that proj is more powerful, I think I can handle find.

== 2011-06-18 ==
Accidentally coded append differently than how I documented. Will fix the code. Documentation FTW!

I can't decide if the geometry functions in $.geo should only accept the base geometry types or not. Initially they will not. I don't want to even think about getting into $.geo.distance(multiPoint, geometryCollection).

$.proj should go up to a three dimensional array to handle the coordinates in a Polygon. Go big or go home, I'm going to support four dimensional arrays so that I can get MultiPolygons as well. That will handle all of the GeoJSON types that have the coordinates property. If you have a GeometryCollection (geometries property), a Feature (geometry property) or a FeatureCollection (features property), then you're on your own.

I may change every mention of "web mercator" to "spherical mercator" to be more specific.

== 2011-06-17 ==
Attempting to change drawPoint from ovals to rounded rectangles. Shortcutting to drawArc if the width/height/borderRadius are the same.

Since I plan to make geographics public at some point, I thought I might make the drawPoint/Line/Polygon functions take actual GeoJSON shapes but I think that might conflict with some functionality internal to the geomap during digitization...I'll have to revisit this.

I seriously need to settle on the word "position" in my code when referring to an array containing an x/y. I use coordinate a bunch because that's what I used in the old project. Oh, but the property name of the GeoJSON object is coordinates. Heh, this is so confusing :) Ok, as I have been doing: coordinates in code, position in documentation.

I'm using cowboy's safeParse but can't tell what it's guarding against. I thought it would always give me a number but that's not the case. Guard against NaN or undefined?

Should drawing a bbox ignore borderRadius? I haven't decided.

You can fill and then stroke the same path, just sayin'.

Point graphics now draw as rounded rectangles. There's weirdness if your sizes are a little off though. I should probably start clamping values to each other like width & height to borderRadius. Yeah, if either is smaller than borderRadius the drawing gets weird. Maybe I should clamp borderRadius instead. Probably. Yeah, have to clamp borderRadius to min(width, height)/2.

I don't think you can disable fill by setting style.fill to "", but you should be allowed. It shouldn't be required to set fillOpacity to 0.

I just dropped a couple loops out of my graphic drawing in geographics. Should help a bit :)

== 2011-06-12 ==
I'm finally pushing the renaming changes to the main project.

=== On examples ===
I talked to Boaz at Bocoup the other day. He suggested cleaning up the examples. I already had this in mind but I should probably do it sooner rather than later. Especially the simplest example. It will look nicer if I cut the div down to 256x256 to match the initial tile I think (done, it already feels better). I do need to keep the examples specific and don't want to add any HTML or JavaScript to them that does not directly relate to the feature I'm testing in the example.

He also suggested unit tests and an API audit, both of which are great ideas and much needed by $.geo.

=== On ovals ===
Peter and I discussed how points are drawn and what width and height mean in geomap styles. We both agree that ovals are not very useful or used constructs in GIS and it would be better to have rounded rectangles. Therefore, I am dropping ovals and intead supporting a borderRadius property. Circles are still possible as long as your width, height and border radius are all the same, you will have a circle. This will be the default.

=== On double-click zoom ===
Peter and I both agree that double-click zoom should operate similar to mouse-wheel zoom in that the bbox should scale according to the placement of the mouse cursor during double-click instead of completely re-centering. You will notice that mouse-wheel feels right and double-click can be confusing.

SUGGESTION: Double-click zoom should scale according to cursor location instead of re-centering

=== On position events ===
I cannot decide if I should officially make the geo argument passed to the position events (move, click, dblclick) a true GeoJSON Point object. The only difference would be the presense of a type property set to "Point". However, the extra pixels property that I have on the geo argument is not part of GeoJSON and will remain in memory. Also, if a developer pushes the new object to a database they are storing extra information that they don't need and will be useless later.

Is the pixels property even that useful? The dev can call geomap.toPixels if they need it. I added the pixels property just because I had the pixels lying around in the internal handling of the event. I think I might just not pass them. It would be more useful to a developer I think to have a true GeoJSON Point object that they can send to geomap.append or a database without worrying about having extra useless data stored with it.

SUGGESTION: Remove the pixels property from position events and add the type property to make the event argument a true GeoJSON Point

I just updated the docs and changed the implementation. I already like this a lot better and am now thinking that the bbox event type could actually send a true GeoJSON Polygon with the bbox property set. That would be totally within the GeoJSON spec and might be useful. That's a bit of extra code on the widget's side though so for now I'm going to leave it as is. I can add that feature later since the current implementation (an object with just a bbox property) is already partially in a true Polygon's spec.

FUTURE SUGGESTION: Send a true GeoJSON Polygon object as the geo argument of bbox events

=== On returning jQuery collections ===
I need to better design the return values of the shape methods other than find & shapeStyle. Should append, remove and emtpy return the jQuery object of the map elements that the call originated from? Probably.

I just tested and yes, as long as you don't issue a return statement inside a jQuery UI widget method, jQuery UI will return the original jQuery collection for you.

== 2011-06-10 ==

=== On geographics ===
I am going to leave drawArc in the graphics widget. The drawPoint method will draw our default point shape (rounded rectangle) but, in the future, when custom drawing is in, a developer can use the drawArc if they want.

=== On proj ===
Peter has updated web mercator <=> geodetic code for me to drop into $.geo.proj.

== 2011-06-06 ==

=== On renaming shape functions ===
Renamed the shape functions. That was annoying but I'm glad I only had addShape implemented.

=== On jQuery UI widgets ===
The widget factory does hide methods that start _ from being called. So much for renaming drawArc to _drawArc and still calling it from geomap.

DEPRECATED SUGGESTION: Turn geographics into a NON-jQuery UI plugin

Did I totally get the scoping wrong for the jQuery UI widget? I have local vars in my initial plugin closure. Will they conflict if there are more than one map?

SUGGESTION: Verify that vars local to initial closure do not conflict when multiple maps are placed

== 2011-06-04 ==

=== drawArc ===
I just realized that by dropping geographics.drawArc in favor of drawPoint I am losing the ability to draw the circles I need for digitization modes. I wonder if, before I turn DrawPoint into a box-like function, that I should copy it to _drawArc. Will jQueryUI.widget let me call it from geomap?

=== shapes ===
Chris and I were talking about merging append (previously addshape) and find into one call: shapes. If you pass a GeoJSON object or array of, it will add them. Otherwise, it will find them. Thinking about this today, I don't quite think that's the way to go. I mostly feel that calling geomap functions to manipulate shapes is closer to adding elements to a jQuery collection. In other words, to call the geomap functions you must have already wrapped an element with jQuery, $("#map").geomap("funcName"). When you wrap elements with jQuery normally, you have to call append, find, etc. Geomap will work the same with. Of course, I do still want the syntactic sugar later: $("#map").append(geoJsonObj);

== 2011-06-02 ==
Who needs a blog. I feel like the best place to keep a developer journal is in the project itself so here we go.

=== On addShape's style argument ===
I showed Peter the shapeStyle demo. He expected that the shape-specific style applied via addShape would only override properties set during addShape. Further manipulation of the base shapeStyle would cascade to the shapes for any properties not explictily set. You know, like CSS. This is obviously the correct way to go and I already forget what made me code it the other way last night. Likely that I was coding at 2am and thought that if a user was passing a style to addShape they would want ALL style properties set in stone for that shape. That is not the right idea. If they want all properties set in stone, they can override all properties in the style object sent to addShape.

I changed the implementation before leaving work.

=== On storing & modifying style ===
My initial implementation drawing shapes in $.geo is very similar to how I did it with our internal control. I also showed Chris the shapeStyle demo and explained how you can add a style that's different from the base style on the map. He suggested that there be a way to change the style of an already added shape. I figured that I could make addShape update existing geometries instead of adding a new one but the syntax felt wrong. An updateShape method would work and could pass right through to addShape internally.

He also suggested allowing access to the internal GeoJSON->style map (as a return value for addShape) so they can maybe change the existing styles that way. However, something doesn't feel correctly designed about that.

We discussed attaching the style to the GeoJSON object. I already had supporting that in mind. If the user happens to have put a style property on the GeoJSON object before passing it to addShape, I would use that when drawing. A style passed to addShape would override that. The cascade would be: base style => GeoJSON object style => addShape style. A developer can keep the style property on the object even when it's stored, such as in GeoCouch, something that Guido wants a lot.

That said, I know I'm going about this wrong. As I said, my initial implementation feels too much like the old one and I want to do something much slicker in the jQuery world. On my walk home, I realized that since I am only storing a reference to the GeoJSON object and the user supplied style I can probably connect the style object to the GeoJSON object using jQuery's data method.

I wasn't sure if targeting a plain object is allowed in jQuery. I know it's possible but that doesn't mean I should. I remember IRC talk about it but forget the outcome. Info on ticket 8108 (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8108) reveals that the DataLink plugin does this so I'm going to assume it's ok.

This little fiddle shows that the data properties don't show up with stringify http://jsfiddle.net/ryanttb/PetpJ/ but I'm going to do more research to see if it changes the object in a way devs will notice.

The data method doesn't natively support namespacing. I could do it myself using a period but I would like to follow what jQuery Mobile is doing with their data attribute stuff. They use data-jm-role which I believe equates to the call .data("jmRole") but I need to check up on that as well. So if I were to do data-geo-style, that would be .data("geoStyle"). I can live with that.

SUGGESTION: Store $.geo styles via $(geoJsonObj).data("geoStyle", style)

=== On shape functions ===
Again, the shape functions feel very old and were grabbed from my internal control. Tonight I was thinking about a new way to do this and it involves being able to wrap GeoJSON objects with jQuery collections and intercept $.fn calls such as .css. Also, non-jQuery UI functions can be added to the geomap widget's div to replace the old addShape method.

For example: $("#map").geomap("addShape", geoJson) could be $("#map").append(geoJson).

How would I add shapes to specific services in the future? $("#map [data-geo-service='OSM']").append(geoJson) maybe.

This might be going too far. Perhaps the old way is fine but use newer names (without the Shape suffix): $("#map").geomap("append", geoJsonObj), $("#map").geomap("append", "OSM", geoJsonObj), $("#map").geomap("remove", geoJsonObj) and $("#map").geomap("empty").

SUGGESTION: Rename the shape manipulation methods

The methods also need to take arrays of GeoJSON objects as returned by databases and jQuery collections of GeoJSON objects as possibly returned by the find method.

SUGGESTION: Shape manipulation methods should handle arrays

Looking back at the above code, I feel like maybe if I really can get the selector-based way to work, e.g., intercept the append call on the geomap widget, I could target the services using a class. They are divs inside the map, I should be able to trap them:

$("#map .OSM").append(geoJsonObj);

That does look really nice.

SUGGESTION: (future) Trap existing jQuery calls: append, remove and emtpy, on both the widget element and the service elements as syntactic sugar, forward them to geomap calls

However, using the class selector feels wrong. Especially if I'm telling them to use the id property when creating the service objects. I could switch it to name when creating the service objects, then:

$("#map [name='OSM']").append(geoJsonObj);

I need to find out if any of this is possible as soon as possible. It's still shorter than calling geomap. I would have to warn users to make sure the space is there, this needs to be a descendant selector.

SUGGESTION: Use name instead of id in the service objects.

=== On finding shapes ===
So you can append and remove shapes. Fine. But I also want a better way to search for shapes. Chris and I mulled over a selector-based way. I think I still want the simplicity of $("#map").geomap("find", position, pixelTol). That will cover a lot of use cases, users click maps a lot.

However, there should be other ways to get at your shapes in a UI widget way:
$("#map").geomap("find", [-67, 43], 8); // find all shapes within 8px of the map position (special case)
$("#map").geomap("find", "[type='Point']"); // Finds all points
$("#map").geomap("find", "[name='OSM'] *"); // all shapes in the OSM service (future)
$("#map").geomap("find", ":intersects(wkt(POINT(-67 43)))"); // Advanced spatial filter, OGC selector names (way future)

Here's how they would look with the future jQuery syntactic sugar:
$("#map").find([-67, 43], 8); // find all shapes within 8px of the map position (special case)
$("#map").find("[type='Point']"); // Finds all points
$("#map [name='OSM']").find(); // all shapes in the OSM service (future)
$("#map").find(":intersects(wkt(POINT(-67 43)))"); // Advanced spatial filter, OGC selector names (way future)
