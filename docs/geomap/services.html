      <p>The services property is an array of service objects. The service objects are JavaScript objects that control how the geomap widget displays map images.</p>
      <p>By default, geomap will display OpenStreetMap tiles. You can change all services at once by setting this property with an entirely new array of service objects. You can set a specific part of of a specific service by getting the current array, modifying, adding or deleting one of the service objects and then re-setting the services property with the modified array.</p>
      <h2>service object</h2>
      <p>A service object has five properties, three of which are required.</p>
      <h3>class</h3>
      <p>Each service needs an class that distinguishes it from other service objects in the array. The class is a string and must be follow the CSS class naming conditions. You can consider this as the class of images the service will supply and usually name it after the service, such as osm, mass-gis, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Please note</b> that even though jQuery Geo releases are labeled alpha, we are porting an internal library to open source &amp; strive for stable releases and easy upgrades and will not usually commit breaking changes. However, prior to alpha 3, this property was called id. This change greatly helps us support multiple maps on a page as well as a geomap function syntax that is more aligned with how jQuery works.</p>
      <h3>type</h3>
      <p>A service has a type property which is either &quot;tiled&quot; or &quot;shingled&quot;. Tiled servies will get one image request per tile needed to fill a given view when the map refreshes. The tile request's bbox will only be the size of the given tile. Shingled services will get only one image request each time the map refreshes and the bbox will be the extent of the whole map view.</p>
      <h3>getUrl</h3>
      <p>The getUrl property of a service object is a function that accepts an object specifying information about the current image request. It must return a URL to an image or null to indicate that no image is required.</p>
      <p>For tiled services, the image is placed at the tile location specified. For shingled services, the image will fill the whole map view.</p>
      <p>If the browser's request of the image results in a 404 status the map will not show that tile or image.</p>
      <p>The argument to the getUrl function has the following properties:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
        <th>bbox (Array)</th><td>A <a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#bounding-boxes" rel="external">GeoJSON bounding box</a> of the current tile or image in map units. If $.geo.proj is not null, the bbox array will be in geodectic coordinates: [ min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat ].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>width (Number)</th><td>The width of the tile or image in pixels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>height (Number)</th><td>The height of the tile or image in pixels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>zoom (Number)</th><td>The current zoom level of the map during this request.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>tile (Object)</th><td>If the service is tiled, this object has column and row properties specifying the location of the tile of this request in the current zoom, otherwise it is null.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>index (Number)</th><td>A whole number which is usually incremented between requests that you can use to cycle image URLs to different index, e.g., if there are four servers hosting the same tile images named tile0, tile1, tile2 and tile3 you can target them in your getUrl function with the string: &quot;tile&quot; + (view.index % 4).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>attr</h3>
      <p>The attr property is optional. It stands for attribution and is a way to give credit to the source of your map imagery. It defaults to an empty string if not specified in a service object. When present, the map widget displays the HTML provided on the bottom-left corner of the map when the service is visible. Users can click links but cannot interact with all other text or images.</p>
      <h3>visible</h3>
      <p>The visible property is optional and defaults to true. It determines whether or not the map will show images from this service while refreshing. You can change the visibility of a service either by changing the visible property of the service object and then setting geomap's services property or by using the toggle convenience method of the geomap widget. The latter is recommended.</p>
      <h3>opacity</h3>
      <p>The opacity property is optional and defaults to 1.0. It determines how transparent a service is when it is visible. Valid values are floating point numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive. Services with an opacity of 0 will not show on the map even if visible is true. You can change the opacity of a service either by changing the opacity property of the service object and then setting geomap's services property or by using the opacity convenience method of the geomap widget. The latter is recommended.</p>
